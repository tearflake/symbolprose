## 1. introduction

Symbolprose is a minimalist programming language designed to serve as both a virtual machine target and a concise medium for expression. Its purpose is twofold:  
1. To provide a low-level but structured execution model, allowing efficient compilation from higher-level languages.  
2. To preserve simplicity in syntax and semantics, lowering the barrier of adoption and making the execution model easy to reason about.  

At its core, Symbolprose embodies the philosophy that computational constructs should be both minimal and compositional. By expressing computation as graphs of nodes and edges with simple instructions, Symbolprose achieves a balance between being close to the machine while still remaining human-readable.  

This document specifies the language, its syntax, semantics, and illustrates its use through a few examples.  

## 2. theoretical background

Symbolprose is intended to represent a fast-executing virtual machine and a compiling target from higher level languages. It provides a functionality trade-off between lower level and higher level programming constructs. The complexity of Symbolprose is intentionally kept simple to take advantage of the potential for its core being cached by the underlying processor unit. At the same time, simple grammar and semantics lower a barrier for a possible programming adoption. Lastly, there may be some beauty factor in pursuing a pure minimalism as a desirable property of any system.

### 2.1. formal syntax

In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language. Symbolprose language itself resembles a kind of S-expression. S-expressions consist of lists of atoms or other S-expressions where lists are surrounded by parenthesis. In Symbolprose, the first list element to the left determines a type of a list. There are a few predefined list types used for data transformation depicted by the following relaxed kind of Backus-Naur form syntax rules:

```
<start> := <graph>

<graph> := (GRAPH <element>+)

<element> := (EDGE (SOURCE <ATOMIC>) (INSTR <instruction>+)? (TARGET <ATOMIC>))
           | (COMPUTE (NAME <ATOMIC>) <start>)

<instruction> := (TEST <ANY> <ANY>)
               | (ASGN <ATOMIC> <ANY>)

<compute-call> := (RUN <name> <params>)
```

The above grammar defines the syntax of Symbolprose. To interpret these grammar rules, we use special symbols: `<...>` for noting identifiers, `... := ...` for expressing assignment, `...+` for one or more occurrences, `...*` for zero or more occurrences, `...?` for optional appearance, and `... | ...` for alternation between expressions. All other symbols are considered as parts of the Symbolprose grammar.

Atoms may be enclosed between a pair of `'` characters  if we want to include special characters used in the grammar. Strings are enclosed between `"` characters. Multiline atoms and strings are enclosed between an odd number of `'` or `"` characters. 
 
In addition to the exposed grammar, user comments have no meaning to the system, but may be descriptive to readers, and may be placed wherever a whitespace is expected. Single line comments begin with `//` and span to the end of line. Multiline comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.

### 2.2 informal semantics

Using S-expressions, Symbolprose defines its model of execution as instruction control flow based on graphs. Graphs consist of nodes and edges which connect nodes. Each node can have multiple edges, each representing a path that a program decides to take during its execution.

### programs

In Symbolprose, graphs represent programs. Here, special nodes `BEGIN` and `END` denote entry and exit point to a program depicted by a graph. In between, there can be arbitrary many other nodes with their own edges, drawing possible program execution lines from the `BEGIN` node to the `END` node.

### instructions

Edges are places where actual execution of instructions are done. Each edge `EDGE` defines `SOURCE` and `TARGET` nodes, while the edge `INSTR` section holds the instructions to execute in sequence. There are two types of instructions: `ASGN` and `TEST`.

`ASGN` instructions take two parameters: a variable name and a S-expression value that is going to be assigned to the variable. The variables are created when they are used for the first time. Before assignment of S-expressions, they are evaluated, substituting contained variables for their values. `ASGN` instructions always succeed and the execution flow continues to the next instruction in the sequence.

`TEST` instructions also take two parameters: expressions which are about to be compared for being equal. Also using the variable substitution, if the parameters are equal to the last consisting atom, the execution flow continues to the next instruction in the sequence. If the parameters are not equal, the branching happens, and the next edge from the same source node is selected for execution. There is no backtracking which cancels the `ASGN` effects from the past instruction sequences. Instead, the control flow is just switched to the beginning of the next edge sequence. When all the edges from the same source node fail to execute, a runtime error is triggered.

Finally, when all the instructions from the current `INSTR` sequence succeed, the program control flow continues to the `TARGET` node, trying to execute further edges that branch from the current node. We can consider each instruction sequence labeled by the `SOURCE` section name, while the `TARGET` section name serves as a kind of "goto" command mechanism. Naturally, it is possible to form loops targeting the past nodes, but we have to carefully set up `TEST` conditions to exit if we don't want an infinite loop to appear.

### internal variables

There are two predefined variables in each graph: `PARAMS` and `RESULT`. When executing a graph, we pass an input which is assigned to the `PARAMS` variable at the beginning of the execution. During the execution, we may assign a value to the `RESULT` builtin variable. On the end of execution, the contents of the `RESULT` builtin variable is returned as an output of the program.

### relating programs in a structure

Graphs can be nested using `COMPUTE` sections, syntactically recursing the graph structure, providing a structure and isolation method to our programs. `COMPUTE` section defines its name and a graph. Here, graphs behave like sub-programs with their own input, output, and variable environment. Graphs defined within the nested `COMPUTE` sections, are executed using a special `RUN` calling instruction which takes two parameters: a graph name and input to the graph. `RUN` calling instructions may be placed wherever program variables may appear, thus computing their results from the passed parameters. Only parents and their siblings graphs are visible to a specific `RUN` instruction.

## 3. examples

Below are a few illustrative examples of Symbolprose programs. 

### Example 1: echo

This program simply echoes its input:

```
(GRAPH
   (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (ASGN x PARAMS)
            (ASGN RESULT x))
        (TARGET END)))
```

### Example 2: ping-pong

The program outputs `pong` when the input is `ping`, otherwise it raises an error:

```
(GRAPH
   (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (TEST PARAMS "ping")
            (ASGN RESULT "pong"))
        (TARGET END)))
```

Note that constants are represented as strings.

### Example 3: hi-bye

Program answers `greeting` on input `hi`, `farewell` on input `bye`, or `unknown` otherwise:

```
(GRAPH
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (TEST PARAMS "hi")
            (ASGN RESULT "greeting"))
        (TARGET END))

    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (TEST PARAMS "bye")
            (ASGN RESULT "farewell"))
        (TARGET END))

    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT "unknown"))
        (TARGET END)))
```

### Example 4: foo-bar

The program outputs `alpha` on `foo` input, `beta` on `bar` input, or `unknown` otherwise:

```
(GRAPH

    // Step 1: Load input
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR (ASGN X PARAMS))
        (TARGET check))

    // Step 2: Check for foo
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE check)
        (INSTR (TEST X "foo"))
        (TARGET match-foo))

    // Step 3: Check for bar
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE check)
        (INSTR (TEST X "bar"))
        (TARGET match-bar))

    // Step 4: Fallback if no match
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE check)
        (TARGET fallback))

    // Step 5: Match case foo
    (EDGE (SOURCE match-foo)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT "alpha"))
        (TARGET END))

    // Step 6: Match case bar
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE match-bar)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT "beta"))
        (TARGET END))

    // Step 7: Default case
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE fallback)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT "unknown"))
        (TARGET END)))
```

### Example 5: is-element-of

This example returns `true` if the first parameter is contained within second parameter list, `false` otherwise:

```
(GRAPH

    // Load variables
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (ASGN Element (RUN stdlib ("nth" "0" PARAMS)))
            (ASGN List    (RUN stdlib ("nth" "1" PARAMS))))
        (TARGET loop))
    
    // Loop condition: if Input is ()
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE loop)
        (INSTR
            (TEST List ())
            (ASGN RESULT "false"))
        (TARGET END)) // done
    
    // Loop condition: if Element is found
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE loop)
        (INSTR
            (TEST Element (RUN stdlib ("first" List)))
            (ASGN RESULT "true"))
        (TARGET END)) // done
    
    // Fallback: process next element in list
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE loop)
        (INSTR (ASGN List (RUN stdlib ("rest" List))))
        (TARGET loop))) // Continue looping
```

### Example 6: reverse list

This program reverses a list:

```
(GRAPH

    // Load Input and initialize accumulator
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR
            (ASGN Input PARAMS)
            (ASGN Acc ()))
        (TARGET loop))

    // Loop condition: if Input is ()
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE loop)
        (INSTR (TEST Input ()))
        (TARGET done)) // go to done
    
    // Fallback: Process one element
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE loop)
        (INSTR
            (ASGN Head (RUN stdlib ("first" Input)))
            (ASGN Tail (RUN stdlib ("rest" Input)))
            (ASGN Acc (RUN stdlib ("prepend" Head Acc)))
            (ASGN Input Tail))
        (TARGET loop)) // Continue looping

    // Final step: store reversed RESULT
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE done)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT Acc))
        (TARGET END)))
```

### Example 7: factorial function

Recursive factorial function - on input `5`, output is `120`:

```
(GRAPH
    (COMPUTE
        (NAME fact)
        (GRAPH
            
            // Base case: if PARAMS == 0 -> return 1
            (EDGE
                (SOURCE BEGIN)
                (INSTR
                    (TEST PARAMS "0")
                    (ASGN RESULT "1"))
                (TARGET END))

            // Recursive case
            (EDGE
                (SOURCE BEGIN)
                (INSTR
                    (ASGN n PARAMS)
                    (ASGN n1 (RUN stdlib ("sub" n "1")))
                    (ASGN rec (RUN fact n1))
                    (ASGN RESULT (RUN stdlib ("mul" n rec))))
                (TARGET END))))

    // Top-level call
    (EDGE
        (SOURCE BEGIN)
        (INSTR (ASGN RESULT (RUN fact PARAMS)))
        (TARGET END)))
```

### Example 8: Fibonacci numbers

Returns a list up to n fibonacci numbers:

```
(GRAPH
    (COMPUTE
        (NAME fib)
        (GRAPH
            
            // fib(0) -> (0)
            (EDGE
                (SOURCE BEGIN)
                (INSTR
                    (TEST PARAMS "0")
                    (ASGN RESULT "0"))
                (TARGET END))

            // fib(1) -> ("0" "1")
            (EDGE
                (SOURCE BEGIN)
                (INSTR
                    (TEST PARAMS "1")
                    (ASGN RESULT "1"))
                (TARGET END))

            // fib(n) -> fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
            (EDGE
                (SOURCE BEGIN)
                (INSTR

## 4. conclusion

Symbolprose provides a foundation for computation that is both graph-structured and minimalistic. Its simplicity in syntax makes it a suitable compilation target, while its semantics offer a precise and predictable model of execution. By embracing graph-based control flow, Symbolprose enables flexible yet analyzable program representation, striving to a balance between theoretical elegance and practical expressiveness.
